Lab Comments & Count Argument
# begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.
// also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to #.
/* and */ are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span over multiple lines.
The # single-line comment style is the default comment style and should be used in most cases. Automatic configuration formatting tools may automatically transform
// comments into # comments, since the double-slash style is not idiomatic.
